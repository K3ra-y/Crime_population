# Project Milestone 4: Write-up


### What changes did you decide to implement given the time limit, and why do you think this is the best thing to focus on?

We decided to implement the following changes:
- Change color of our bar plots and line plots, to match with the color of the theme we choose
- Update the column name of the amount, from `count_per_100k` to `incidents_per_100k_population`
- The information was added into a third panel in the application with matching color theme and graphics colors.

For the first change, we thought it would complete the appearance of our app, to provide a consist user experience. In our app, when users hover on the plots or viewing the data in the table tab, the major variable was represented by the name `count_per_100k`, which does not provide enough information, so we changed it to `incidents_per_100k_population`. Since the application was missing information on where the data was sourced from and the repository link along with the developers' accounts, we added a third panel and put all the necessary information in that panel.

### If you were to make the app again from scratch (or some other app in general), what would you do differently?

If we were to make a shiny app again from the scratch, we would spend more time exploring the implementations in shiny and brainstorming possible ways of presenting our data. We gained some experiences on this during this block and improved our app from draft in various ways. However, we did have to rebuild the app several times when we could have spend the time on incorporating more advanced features.

For further development, a time series analysis and their reflection the application would have to take the trend to next level. Given the time frame we could not deliver statistical meanings behind the trends. If we had the experience we gained during development, we could have had time to implement statistical analysis into the application.


### What were the greatest challenges you faced in creating the final product?

Shiny is user and developer friendly. Lack of experience was an obstacle at the beginning. Both of our team members were new to shiny, with the limited time we could spend exploring it, we had some difficulties on first design. However this project helped us to learn a lot on shiny as well as data presentation, and we overcame the barrier during development.
