# Project Milestone 3: Write-up


## *Reflection on the usefulness of the feedback you received.*


The feedback session was productive with critical points raised, which improved both the usability and visual quality of the application. The peer reviewers found it easy to navigate through the application and extract the information of their interest. Initial deployment included both the total comparison plot and the cross-city comparison in the same page, which was confusing for the peers since these two graphs did not interact. The graphs are separated into different panels. The peer reviewers also suggested increasing the font size for the plots as well as adding hover effects to help users access information. Additionally, we changed the theme to a more user-friendly concept. 

Most improvements suggested on the feedback was accomplishable given the time frame. However, we did not implement an issue related to compiling average crime across all US cities in the graph. The application was designed to compare selected cities over a time frame of interest of the user. An additional line for average across the cities may confuse the user and may not be suitable since the United States is highly diverse with different socio-economical structures and different trends in terms of crime rates. However, this suggestion inspired us to include a line that is calculated by the mean crime rate of *selected cities*.
The feedback we received from our peers was valuable, reasonable and useful. The feedback process helped us improve the application to the next level.

## *Reflection on how your project has changed since Milestone 2, and why.*

The project was improved over the initial implementation by this collaborative work. The reason for this change is the amount of time invested, the constructive feedback we received from the peer reviewers and the teaching assistant. The objective has not changed; in fact, it has been implemented in a way that the application meets with the objective with better visualization.
